## About Me

👩🏽‍💻 **I'm a UC Berkeley grad (Data Science) who loves bringing technical depth and creative intuition together to solve meaningful problems. With a product mindset and a passion for building AI tools that work in the real world, I focus on creating systems that are scalable, explainable, and user-centered.**

Here’s what I’m most passionate about:

- 🤖 **End-to-End Model Development** – I build from scratch: modeling logic, data wrangling, training, evaluation, and tuning with clear metrics (R², OSR², F1).
- 📱 **iOS + CoreML in Progress** – I’m actively exploring Swift and CoreML to bring ML to mobile and build apps with real-world value.
- 🎓 **Teaching + Technical Communication** – As a tech instructor and writing tutor, I know how to explain complex systems to diverse learners and stakeholders.
- 📚 ML/DL Research Enthusiast – I regularly read and synthesize the latest machine learning and deep learning papers to stay current with advancements in the field.
