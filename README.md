## About Me

👩🏽‍💻 **I'm a UC Berkeley grad (Data Science) who loves bringing technical depth and creative intuition together to solve meaningful problems. With a product mindset and a passion for building AI tools that work in the real world, I focus on creating systems that are scalable, explainable, and user-centered.**

Here’s what I’m most passionate about:

- 🤖 **End-to-End Model Development** – I build from scratch: modeling logic, data wrangling, training, evaluation, and tuning with clear metrics (R², OSR², F1).
- 📱 **iOS + CoreML in Progress** – I’m actively exploring Swift and CoreML to bring ML to mobile and build apps with real-world value.
- 🎓 **Teaching + Technical Communication** – As a tech instructor and writing tutor, I know how to explain complex systems to diverse learners and stakeholders.
- 📚 ML/DL Research Enthusiast – I regularly read and synthesize the latest machine learning and deep learning papers to stay current with advancements in the field.

## 🔬 Featured Projects
📌 🍕 [**Bite by Byte: Modeling Nutritional Value in Fast Food**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qnMPtRRKZ6BdIJk8u_-_9RT7YT_7Z9Gk?usp=sharing)

This project uses machine learning to predict the healthiness of fast food items from publicly available nutrition data. I built models including Random Forest, XGBoost, and a Voting Ensemble, and contributed to the final analysis and report. The workflow covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation—offering a clear reference for applying ML to real-world tabular data.

📌 🦑 [**Squid Game Neural Net**](https://deepnote.com/app/zewdis-first-project/Squid-Game-Model-7ef8e996-cf1b-4c33-b841-018900a3e6d2?)

Click above to explore a multi-output neural network that predicts Squid Game contestants' survival, risk-taking, and alliances based on features like age and debt. The project walks through data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation—offering a clear path for anyone interested in building interpretable ML pipelines with real-world-inspired data.

📌 🧠 [**Rhetoric Intensity Classifier**](https://github.com/zewdih/rhetoric-intensity-classifier)

A multi-class NLP classifier that predicts the intensity of political rhetoric using TF-IDF features and supervised learning. The project walks through text preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation—providing a useful guide for applying NLP to political language analysis.
