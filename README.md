## About Me

👩🏽‍💻 **Data Scientist, ML Engineer, and Software Engineer** with a product mindset and a passion for building AI tools that work in the real world. I'm a UC Berkeley grad (Data Science) who loves bringing technical depth and creative intuition together to solve meaningful problems.  

Here’s what I’m most passionate about:

- 🐾 **Applied ML + Computer Vision** – From classifying political rhetoric to building Mood Paw AI, I love making ML models that explain, interpret, and interact with the world.
- 🧠 **End-to-End Model Development** – I build from scratch: modeling logic, data wrangling, training, evaluation, and tuning with clear metrics (R², OSR², F1).
- 🛠️ **Developer Tools + UX** – Whether it's web apps, educational tools, or internal dashboards, I aim to build intuitive interfaces on top of powerful systems.
- 📱 **iOS + CoreML in Progress** – I’m actively exploring Swift and CoreML to bring ML to mobile and build apps with real-world value.
- 🎓 **Teaching + Technical Communication** – As a tech instructor and writing tutor, I know how to explain complex systems to diverse learners and stakeholders.
